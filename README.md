# Image_Classification_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks
In this project, 2 different image datasets are used to train and test a custom convolutional neural network which is our classifier that is built using objax in python. Afterwards, the question of how do hyperparameters interact is answered by developing multiple experiments.
